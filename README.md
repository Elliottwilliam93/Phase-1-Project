# DnD5e Monster Finder!

Hello, and welcome to my project!
This website that im designing makes use of a fetch method to pull objects from a DnD API that I found online and allows the user to search for which ever monster/creature
that is in vanilla DnD5e. It also allows the user to leave a comment on the page about which monster is their favorite as well as like it!
When a user puts a valid monster name into the search bar and clicks on the search button, the website will pull up a card of the monster.
The new monster card has a name, challenge rating, size, type, alignment, and a like button.
Just as well I made it so that when a user pulls up a monster card, it will have a picture in the middle that changes based on the challenge rating
of the monster.
For some design I also added a background to the webpage of some amazing DnD art I found online that changes every 10 seconds and I also gave it a fade
effect!
